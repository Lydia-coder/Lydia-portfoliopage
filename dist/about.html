            My name is Lydia Michael Smeets I am a graduate of Codaisseur
            Academy for full-stack web development. My previous background is in
            sales and teaching, in both those fields I developed communicative
            skills and leadership skills. But I decided to make a change and
            pursuit my dream to learn how to code. It was something that I
            always wanted to learn, because the bootcamp was fulltime I had to
            balance being a mother and student. I had to manage my time between
            my studies and my son, this was hard but I managed it, resulting in
            my graduation from the bootcamp. Now I am searching for a position
            as a junior web developer, where I can grow as a professional and a
            person.

            I applied to Codaisseur academy the Netherlands number one bootcamp.
            To become eligible I had to take a test and I passed, only 35% of
            applicants do. I followed the bootcamp for eleven weeks, where I
            learned a lot of new technologies in a very short amount of time
            (please check my Github for examples). My final assignment was to
            build a full stack app in only four days and of course I passed.
